# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you would do:
# --disable=all --enable=similarities
# If you want to run only the classes checker, but have no Warning level
# messages displayed, use:
# --disable=all --enable=classes --disable=W
